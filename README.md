# FIFA 21 Player Dataset `Cleaning with Excel` Project 

## Project Overview:

This repository encapsulates the meticulous data cleaning and preparation of a FIFA 21 player dataset using Microsoft Excel. The project aimed to ensure that the dataset was transformed into a clean, organized, and standardized format, making it well-suited for further analysis. The cleaning process involved various critical steps and employed a series of Excel formulas, all of which are thoroughly documented in the "cleaning process.xlsx" file, provided in the project files.

## Data Cleaning Steps:

- **Eliminating Unnecessary Columns**: Irrelevant columns were pruned from the dataset to enhance its clarity and focus on essential information.

- **Column Naming**: All relevant columns were given descriptive and suitable names to improve data comprehension and analysis.

- **Height and Weight Formatting**: The 'Height' and 'Weight' columns underwent formatting to ensure consistent representation and were converted into numeric formats for robust analysis.

- **Date of Join Formatting**: The 'Joined' column was converted into the appropriate date format, and new columns were added to extract the year and month of joining. Additionally, an extra column was created to calculate the number of years each player has participated.

- **Value, Wage, and Release Clause Cleansing**: These columns were meticulously cleaned by removing any unnecessary newline characters and transforming the values into numeric formats, rendering them suitable for precise analysis.

- **Newline Character Stripping**: In columns such as 'W/F,' 'SM,' and 'IR,' extraneous newline characters were stripped, enhancing data consistency and clarity.

- **Hits Column Transformation**: The 'Hits' column was transformed to retain only numeric values, ensuring its compatibility for analysis.
